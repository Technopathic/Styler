## Requirements
Before you get started developing with Styler, ensure you have the following:

* An HTTP Web Server (Apache or Nginx)
* MySQL
* PHP 7.x
* Composer
* NPM
* React-Native

## Built With
* PHP Laravel Framework - Our Back-End API is a Laravel App. It takes requrests and makes responses in JSON.
* React-Native - Our Front-End is a React-Native App which communicates with the Laravel API.
* MySQL - Our main database is MySQL for storing heavy amounts of data.

Plus a number of Laravel and JavaScript packages. See the complete lists in the composer.json and package.json files.

## Development
I have mainly open-sourced my apps so people may be able to use my source code for research and so I can demonstrate my abilities. I am always open to reviewing feedback about my projects and any issue / pull requests.

When it comes to my mobile apps, I usually break down my apps in two separate repos. One repo will be the Front-End and another repo will be the Back-End.

#### Front-End
```
git clone repo
cd repo
npm install
react-native run-android
```

#### Back-End
```
git clone repo
cd repo
Set up your .env file with your MySQL information
composer install
php artisan serve --host=127.0.0.1 --port=8000
```
